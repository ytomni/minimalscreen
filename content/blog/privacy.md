In todays digital age it is important to stay private, you shouldn't blindly register on sites you do not need, you shouldn't accept that most corporations use your data to learn everything about you, so they can serve ads that are targeted directly at you. To adjust prices based on your phone, location, or age.

If you have a Google account this is what they will know about you:
- Email address
- Current location
- Name
- All your emails
- Every website you visit
- Every ad you click on
- What videos you watch
- IP address
- Where you work
- What you search for
- and more...

I'm sure you have a Facebook account, instagram account as well (similar to Google):
- Name
- Email address
- What ads you press on
- What ads you look at
- Your location
- What sites you visit (Meta pixel)
- Your interests

These companies need this information because they're a _free_ service. They use your data to serve you ads based on your interests, to get you to consume. When a service is free you are the product.

### How does digital minimalism come in?
Digital minimalism is about decreasing your usage of social media, you could say technology in general, but to me, that is too much. Decreasing your social media usage will drastically increase you _digital minimalism_. You will no longer be addicted to the platforms that want to know everything you do. You will have more control over your life.
