# minimalscreen - introduction

Hi, I'm **KS**. This site was created to assist myself and others on how to minimize screen time, digital footprints and increase privacy in the digital world.

---
## Why?
The largest tech companies do not want you to be free. They want all your attention, they **NEED** your attention to stay in business. Without you, the consumer they will not make any money. That's why it's important for you to realize that you need to stop giving them what they want. 

That is why this site will be about decreasing your usage of social media, screen time, and, regaining privacy.
