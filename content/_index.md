# Introduction

Hello, I'm **KS**. I created this tiny site to help others decrease their social media presence, and regain control over your data. I hope you find some of it useful!

---
## Privacy
The largest tech companies do not want you to be free. They want all your attention, they **NEED** your attention to stay in business. Without you, the consumer they will not make any money. That's why it's important for you to realize that you need to stop giving them what they want. 
> "We know where you are, we know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about." - Eric Schmidt (Former Google CEO)

That is why this site will be about decreasing your usage of social media, screen time, and, regaining privacy. 

## Minimalism
Becoming a digital minimalist means you will setup strict routines of what you're allowed to use, and when you're allowed to use them. Substantially decreasing the amount of information you give to big tech.
> "People don't succumb to screens because they're lazy, but instead because billions of dollars have been invested to make this outcome inevitable." - Cal Newport
## Addiction
We are social animals, we care what others think. We crave social approval. We can't ignore what other people think of us. Consider the feedback buttons on social media, when people click that "Like" button or they leave a comment it feels like you get approved for what you're doing. That's your brain going "Keep doing this!".

Our brain has for centuries been evolved to react like this to positive feedback. That's why these feedback buttons were created. They were created because billions of dollars are being invested to see what gets you hooked. The creator of the "Like" button on Facebook (Leah Pearlman) actively avoids social media because she knows how **destructive** and **manipulative** it is.

**It is time to take back control and embrace digital minimalism.**
